# ⏱️ Multiplication Blitz

Multiplication Blitz is a fast-paced, timed flash card game designed to sharpen your multiplication skills under pressure. Beat the clock and set a new high score before the fuse runs out!

## 🚀 Features

- **Timed Gameplay:** A visual fuse (progress bar) gives you 10 seconds to answer each question. Answer correctly to reset the timer and keep the game going!

- **High Score Tracking:** Your best score is saved locally, encouraging you to keep improving your multiplication speed.

- **Dynamic Feedback:** Instant visual and textual feedback (correct answer resets timer, incorrect answer shows temporary error).

- **Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized for playing on both mobile devices and desktop browsers.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Start:** The game begins automatically with a multiplication problem displayed in the center.

2. **Watch the Fuse:** The green/yellow/red fuse bar at the top indicates your remaining time. If the fuse reaches the bomb (💣), the game ends!

3. **Answer:** Type your numerical answer into the input field.

4. **Check:** Press the Check Answer button or hit the Enter key.

- **Correct:** Your score increases, the fuse resets, and a new question appears.

- **Incorrect:** The check button flashes red, and you must correct your answer (or try a different one) before the timer runs out.

5. **Game Over:** The game ends when the timer hits zero. Your final score is displayed, and your High Score is updated if you've surpassed it.
